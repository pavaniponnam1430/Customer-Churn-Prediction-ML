# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer will churn based on their usage and account details using Machine Learning classification models.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major issue in many industries. This project builds a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to leave a service.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy in predicting churn.
